# openrack
3D Web Visualiser for Designing Rack Mountable Systems and Network Cabinets for Critical Infrastructure

![screenshot](/img/DOCS/screenshot.png)

The textures included in this visualiser are replaceable with PNG image textures of around 500x500px. \
Visualising Systems is considerably less expensive, more environmentally friendly and less error-prone \
compared to building the real life equivalent of such a system - that also requires more effort and resources.

Each manufacturer designs their ideal rack mountable system for themselves once in real life and then again \
in a 3D virtual space. An entirely theoretical architecture is also possible to design, removing the need to \
manufacture it in the real world.

Integrating these systems together in the form of imaginary models and image textures results in a composition \
which would otherwise be either impossible or difficult to achieve for one person alone with limited resources.

# Cabinets

While choosing textures in OpenRack, the following 6 classes of server were derived:
```
Cabinet 1 - The Pro-Tools Starter Kit [ENTRY]
Cabinet 2 - Edgecore and Architectural [EDGE]
Cabinet 3 - Specialist Monitoring Equipment [SPECIALIST]
Cabinet 4 - Realistic Industrial Economy Class [ECONOMY]
Cabinet 5 - Top-End Super-Rich Class [PERFORMANCE]
Cabinet 6 - Mission Critical Robustness Class [CRITICAL]
```
These Categories can further be split into 2 groups of 3 subcategories:
```
Specification Levels: [ENTRY], [EDGE], [SPECIALIST] \
Infrastructure Levels: [ECONOMY], [PERFORMANCE], [CRITICAL]
```
